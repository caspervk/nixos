  # Simple NixOS Mailserver.
  # https://nixos-mailserver.readthedocs.io
  # https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Imapsync

  # INCOMING mail is delegated to mail.caspervk.net by each domain, e.g.
  # vkristensen.dk.
  #
  # vkristensen.dk.zone:
  #
  # @                         IN  MX    10 mail.caspervk.net.
  #
  # For anti-spam purposes, mail.caspervk.net MUST be an A/AAAA record (not
  # CNAME) and the IP-addresses MUST point back to mail.caspervk.net using a
  # reverse pointer record:
  #
  # caspervk.net.zone:
  #
  # mail                      IN  A     49.13.33.75
  # 75.33.13.49.in-addr.arpa. IN  PTR   mail.caspervk.net.

  # OUTGOING mail is sent through icloud because email is a racket where the
  # big providers only accept mail from the other big providers. Perfect
  # SPF/DKIM? Well fuck you. If you're lucky we'll send you to spam, otherwise
  # it's straight to /dev/null. What happened to the decentralised internet!?
  # At least give me a chance until you've actually seen me send spam??
  # https://www.icloud.com/icloudplus/customdomain
  #
  # Anyway.. Each domain delegates SPF and DMARC to mail.caspervk.net so we
  # only have to define the policies once, and adds icloud's dkim key:
  #
  # vkristensen.dk.zone:
  #
  # @                         IN  TXT   "v=spf1 redirect=mail.caspervk.net"
  # _dmarc                    IN  CNAME _dmarc.mail.caspervk.net.
  # sig1._domainkey           IN  CNAME sig1.dkim.caspervk.net.at.icloudmailadmin.com.
  #
  # The SPF and DMARC policies are defined centrally.
  #
  # caspervk.net.zone:
  #
  #  mail                     IN  TXT   "v=spf1 ..."
  # _dmarc.mail               IN  TXT   "v=DMARC1; ..."
