  # Bridges are Tor relays that help circumvent censorship. WebTunnel is a
  # censorship-resistant pluggable transport designed to mimic encrypted web
  # traffic (HTTPS). It works by wrapping the payload connection into a
  # WebSocket-like HTTPS connection, appearing to network observers as an
  # ordinary HTTPS (WebSocket) connection.
