  # Impermanence in NixOS is where the root directory isn't permanent, but gets
  # wiped every reboot (such as by mounting it as tmpfs). Such a setup is
  # possible because NixOS only needs /boot and /nix in order to boot, all
  # other system files are simply links to files in /nix.

  # The impermanence module bind-mounts persistent files and directories,
  # stored in /nix/persist, into the tmpfs root partition on startup. For
  # example: /nix/persist/etc/machine-id is mounted to /etc/machine-id.
